Avrotize is a ["Rosetta Stone"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) for data structure definitions, allowing you to convert between numerous data and database schema formats and to generate code for different programming languages.

It is, for instance, a well-documented and predictable converter and code generator for data structures originally defined in JSON Schema (of arbitrary complexity).

The tool leans on the Apache Avro-derived [Avrotize Schema](specs/avrotize-schema.md) as its schema model.

- Programming languages: Python, C#, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, Go, C++
- SQL Databases: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, SQLite, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, DB2
- Other databases: KQL/Kusto, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Elasticsearch, DynamoDB, CosmosDB
- Data schema formats: Avro, JSON Schema, XML Schema (XSD), Protocol Buffers 2 and 3, ASN.1, Apache Parquet

## Installation

## Overview

You can use Avrotize to convert between Avro/Avrotize Schema and other schema formats like JSON Schema, XML Schema (XSD), Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), ASN.1, and database schema formats like Kusto Data Table Definition (KQL) and SQL Table Definition. That means you can also convert from JSON Schema to Protobuf going via Avrotize Schema.

You can also generate C#, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python code from Avrotize Schema documents. The difference to the native Avro tools is that Avrotize can emit data classes without Avro library dependencies and, optionally, with annotations for JSON serialization libraries like Jackson or System.Text.Json.

The tool does not convert data (instances of schemas), only the data structure definitions.

Mind that the primary objective of the tool is the conversion of schemas that describe data structures used in applications, databases, and message systems. While the project's internal tests do cover a lot of ground, it is nevertheless not a primary goal of the tool to convert every complex document schema like those used for devops pipeline or system configuration files.

## Why?

Data structure definitions are an essential part of data exchange, serialization, and storage. They define the shape and type of data, and they are foundational for tooling and libraries for working with the data. Nearly all data schema languages are coupled to a specific data exchange or storage format, locking the definitions to that format.

Avrotize is designed as a tool to "unlock" data definitions from JSON Schema or XML Schema and make them usable in other contexts. The intent is also to lay a foundation for transcoding data from one format to another, by translating the schema definitions as accurately as possible into the schema model of the target format's schema. The transcoding of the data itself requires separate tools that are beyond the scope of this project.

The use of the term "data structure definition" and not "data object definition" is quite intentional. The focus of the tool is on data structures that can be used for messaging and eventing payloads, for data serialization, and for database tables, with the goal that those structures can be mapped cleanly from and to common programming language types.

Therefore, Avrotize intentionally ignores common techniques to model object-oriented inheritance. For instance, when converting from JSON Schema, all content from `allOf` expressions is merged into a single record type rather than trying to model the inheritance tree in Avro.

## Avrotize Schema

Avrotize Schema is a schema model that is a full superset of the popular Apache Avro Schema model. Avrotize Schema is the "pivot point" for this tool. All schemas are converted from and to Avrotize Schema.

Since Avrotize Schema is a superset of Avro Schema and uses its extensibility features, every Avrotize Schema is also a valid Avro Schema and vice versa.

Why did we pick Avro Schema as the foundational schema model?

Avro Schema ...

- provides a simple, clean, and concise way to define data structures. It is quite easy to understand and use.
- is self-contained by design without having or requiring external references. Avro Schema can express complex data structure hierarchies spanning multiple namespace boundaries all in a single file, which neither JSON Schema nor XML Schema nor Protobuf can do.
- can be resolved by code generators and other tools "top-down" since it enforces dependencies to be ordered such that no forward-referencing occurs.
- emerged out of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem and is widely used for serialization and storage of data and for data exchange between systems.
- supports native and logical types that cover the needs of many business and technical use cases.
- can describe the popular JSON data encoding very well and in a way that always maps cleanly to a wide range of programming languages and systems. In contrast, it's quite easy to inadvertently define a JSON Schema that is very difficult to map to a programming language structure.
- is itself expressed as JSON. That makes it easy to parse and generate, which is not the case for Protobuf or ASN.1, which require bespoke parsers.

> It needs to be noted here that while Avro Schema is great for defining data structures, and data classes generated from Avro Schema using this tool or other tools can be used to with the most popular JSON serialization libraries, the Apache Avro project's own JSON encoding has fairly grave interoperability issues with common usage of JSON. Avrotize defines an alternate JSON encoding

 in [`avrojson.md`](avrojson.md).

Avro Schema does not support all the bells and whistles of XML Schema or JSON Schema, but that is a feature, not a bug, as it ensures the portability of the schemas across different systems and infrastructures. Specifically, Avro Schema does not support many of the data validation features found in JSON Schema or XML Schema. There are no `pattern`, `format`, `minimum`, `maximum`, or `required` keywords in Avro Schema, and Avro does not support conditional validation.

In a system where data originates as XML or JSON described by a validating XML Schema or JSON Schema, the assumption we make here is that data will be validated using its native schema language first, and then the Avro Schema will be used for transformation or transfer or storage.

## Adding CloudEvents columns for database tables

When converting Avrotize Schema to Kusto Data Table Definition (KQL), SQL Table Definition, or Parquet Schema, the tool can add special columns for [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) attributes. CNCF CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in a common way.

The rationale for adding such columns to database tables is that messages and events commonly separate event metadata from the payload data, while that information is merged when events are projected into a database. The metadata often carries important context information about the event that is not contained in the payload itself. Therefore, the tool can add those columns to the database tables for easy alignment of the message context with the payload when building event stores.

### Convert Proto schema to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize p2a <path_to_proto_file> [--out <path_to_avro_schema_file>]
```

Parameters:

- `<path_to_proto_file>`: The path to the Protobuf schema file to be converted. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to write the conversion result to. If omitted, the output is directed to stdout.

Conversion notes:

- Proto 2 and Proto 3 syntax are supported.
- Proto package names are mapped to Avro namespaces. The tool does resolve imports and consolidates all imported types into a single Avrotize Schema file.
- The tool embeds all 'well-known' Protobuf 3.0 types in Avro format and injects them as needed when the respective types are imported. Only the `Timestamp` type is mapped to the Avro logical type 'timestamp-millis'. The rest of the well-known Protobuf types are kept as Avro record types with the same field names and types.
- Protobuf allows any scalar type as key in a `map`, Avro does not. When converting from Proto to Avro, the type information for the map keys is ignored.
- The field numbers in message types are not mapped to the positions of the fields in Avro records. The fields in Avro are ordered as they appear in the Proto schema. Consequently, the Avrotize Schema also ignores the `extensions` and `reserved` keywords in the Proto schema.
- The `optional` keyword results in an Avro field being nullable (union with the `null` type), while the `required` keyword results in a non-nullable field. The `repeated` keyword results in an Avro field being an array of the field type.
- The `oneof` keyword in Proto is mapped to an Avro union type.
- All `options` in the Proto schema are ignored.

### Convert Avrotize Schema to Proto schema

```bash
avrotize a2p <path_to_avro_schema_file> [--out <path_to_proto_directory>] [--naming <naming_mode>] [--allow-optional]
```

Parameters:

- `<path_to_avro_schema_file>`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out`: The path to the Protobuf schema directory to write the conversion result to. If omitted, the output is directed to stdout.
- `--naming`: (optional) Type naming convention. Choices are `snake`, `camel`, `pascal`.
- `--allow-optional`: (optional) Enable support for 'optional' fields.

Conversion notes:

- Avro namespaces are resolved into distinct proto package definitions. The tool will create a new `.proto` file with the package definition and an `import` statement for each namespace found in the Avrotize Schema.
- Avro type unions `[]` are converted to `oneof` expressions in Proto. Avro allows for maps and arrays in the type union, whereas Proto only supports scalar types and message type references. The tool will therefore emit message types containing a single array or map field for any such case and add it to the containing type, and will also recursively resolve further unions in the array and map values.
- The sequence of fields in a message follows the sequence of fields in the Avro record. When type unions need to be resolved into `oneof` expressions, the alternative fields need to be assigned field numbers, which will shift the field numbers for any subsequent fields.

### Convert JSON schema to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize j2a <path_to_json_schema_file> [--out <path_to_avro_schema_file>] [--namespace <avro_schema_namespace>] [--split-top-level-records]
```

Parameters:

- `<path_to_json_schema_file>`: The path to the JSON schema file to be converted. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to write the conversion result to. If omitted, the output is directed to stdout.
- `--namespace`: (optional) The namespace to use in the Avrotize Schema if the JSON schema does not define a namespace.
- `--split-top-level-records`: (optional) Split top-level records into separate files.

### Convert Avrotize Schema to JSON schema

```bash
avrotize a2j <path_to_avro_schema_file> [--out <path_to_json_schema_file>] [--naming <naming_mode>]
```

Parameters:

- `<path_to_avro_schema_file>`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out`: The path to the JSON schema file to write the conversion result to. If omitted, the output is directed to stdout.

### Convert XML Schema (XSD) to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize x2a <path_to_xsd_file> [--out <path_to_avro_schema_file>] [--namespace <avro_schema_namespace>]
```

Parameters:

- `<path_to_xsd_file>`: The path to the XML schema file to be converted. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to write the conversion result to. If omitted, the output is directed to stdout.
- `--namespace`: (optional) The namespace to use in the Avrotize Schema if the XML schema does not define a namespace.

Conversion notes:

- All XML Schema constructs are mapped to Avro record types with fields, whereby **both**, elements and attributes, become fields in the record. XML is therefore flattened into fields and this aspect of the structure is not preserved.
- Avro does not support `xsd:any` as Avro does not support arbitrary typing and must always use a named type. The tool will map `xsd:any` to a field `any` typed as a union that allows scalar values or two levels of array and/or map nesting.
- `simpleType` declarations that define enums are mapped to `enum` types in Avro. All other facets are ignored and simple types are mapped to the corresponding Avro type.
- `complexType` declarations that have simple content where a base type is augmented with attributes is mapped to a record type in Avro. Any other facets defined on the complex type are ignored.
- If the schema defines a single root element, the tool will emit a single Avro record type. If the schema defines multiple root elements, the tool will emit a union of record types, each corresponding to a root element.
- All fields in the resulting Avrotize Schema are annotated with an `xmlkind` extension attribute that indicates whether the field was an `element` or an `attribute` in the XML schema.

### Convert Avrotize Schema to XML schema

```bash
avrotize a2x <path_to_avro_schema_file> [--out <path_to_xsd_schema_file>] [--namespace <target_namespace>]
```

Parameters:

- `<path_to_avro_schema_file>`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out`: The path to the XML schema file to write the conversion result to. If omitted, the output is directed to stdout.
- `--namespace`: (optional) Target namespace for the XSD schema.

Conversion notes:

- Avro record types are mapped to XML Schema complex types with elements.
- Avro enum types are mapped to XML Schema simple types with restrictions.
- Avro logical types are mapped to XML Schema simple types with restrictions where required.
- Avro unions are mapped to standalone XSD simple type definitions with a union restriction if all union types are primitives.
- Avro unions with complex types are resolved into distinct types for each option that are

 then joined with a choice.

### Convert JSON Structure to XML Schema (XSD)

```bash
avrotize s2x <path_to_structure_file> [--out <path_to_xsd_schema_file>] [--namespace <target_namespace>]
```

Parameters:

- `<path_to_structure_file>`: The path to the JSON Structure schema file to be converted. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out`: The path to the XML schema file to write the conversion result to. If omitted, the output is directed to stdout.
- `--namespace`: (optional) Target namespace for the XSD schema.

Conversion notes:

- JSON Structure object types are mapped to XML Schema complex types with elements.
- JSON Structure primitive types (string, int8-128, uint8-128, float/double, boolean, etc.) are mapped to appropriate XSD simple types.
- Extended primitive types are mapped as follows:
  - `binary`/`bytes` → `xs:base64Binary`
  - `date` → `xs:date`
  - `time` → `xs:time`
  - `datetime`/`timestamp` → `xs:dateTime`
  - `duration` → `xs:duration`
  - `uuid` → `xs:string`
  - `uri` → `xs:anyURI`
  - `decimal` → `xs:decimal`
- Collection types:
  - `array` and `set` → complex types with sequences of items
  - `map` → complex type with entry elements containing key and value
  - `tuple` → complex type with fixed sequence of typed items
- Union types (`choice` or type arrays like `["string", "null"]`):
  - Tagged unions (with discriminator) → `xs:choice` elements
  - Inline unions → abstract base types with concrete extensions
  - Nullable types → elements with `minOccurs="0"`
- Type references (`$ref`) are resolved to named XSD types
- Type extensions (`$extends`) are mapped to XSD complex type extensions with `xs:complexContent`
- Abstract types are marked with `abstract="true"` in XSD
- Validation constraints (minLength, maxLength, pattern, minimum, maximum) are converted to XSD restrictions/facets
- Required properties become elements with `minOccurs="1"`, optional properties have `minOccurs="0"`

### Convert ASN.1 schema to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize asn2a <path_to_asn1_schema_file>[,<path_to_asn1_schema_file>,...] [--out <path_to_avro_schema_file>]
```

Parameters:

- `<path_to_asn1_schema_file>`: The path to the ASN.1 schema file to be converted. The tool supports multiple files in a comma-separated list. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to write the conversion result to. If omitted, the output is directed to stdout.

Conversion notes:

- All ASN.1 types are mapped to Avro record types, enums, and unions. Avro does not support the same level of nesting of types as ASN.1, the tool will map the types to the best fit.
- The tool will map the following ASN.1 types to Avro types:
  - `SEQUENCE` and `SET` are mapped to Avro record types.
  - `CHOICE` is mapped to an Avro record types with all fields being optional. While the `CHOICE` type technically corresponds to an Avro union, the ASN.1 type has different named fields for each option, which is not a feature of Avro unions.
  - `OBJECT IDENTIFIER` is mapped to an Avro string type.
  - `ENUMERATED` is mapped to an Avro enum type.
  - `SEQUENCE OF` and `SET OF` are mapped to Avro array type.
  - `BIT STRING` is mapped to Avro bytes type.
  - `OCTET STRING` is mapped to Avro bytes type.
  - `INTEGER` is mapped to Avro long type.
  - `REAL` is mapped to Avro double type.
  - `BOOLEAN` is mapped to Avro boolean type.
  - `NULL` is mapped to Avro null type.
  - `UTF8String`, `PrintableString`, `IA5String`, `BMPString`, `NumericString`, `TeletexString`, `VideotexString`, `GraphicString`, `VisibleString`, `GeneralString`, `UniversalString`, `CharacterString`, `T61String` are all mapped to Avro string type.
  - All other ASN.1 types are mapped to Avro string type.
- The ability to parse ASN.1 schema files is limited and the tool may not be able to parse all ASN.1 files. The tool is based on the Python asn1tools package and is limited to that package's capabilities.

### Convert Kusto table definition to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize k2a --kusto-uri <kusto_cluster_uri> --kusto-database <kusto_database> [--out <path_to_avro_schema_file>] [--emit-cloudevents-xregistry]
```

Parameters:

- `--kusto-uri`: The URI of the Kusto cluster to connect to.
- `--kusto-database`: The name of the Kusto database to read the table definitions from.
- `--out`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to write the conversion result to. If omitted, the output is directed to stdout.
- `--emit-cloudevents-xregistry`: (optional) See discussion below.

Conversion notes:

- The tool directly connects to the Kusto cluster and reads the table definitions from the specified database. The tool will convert all tables in the database to Avro record types, returned in a top-level type union.
- Connecting to the Kusto cluster leans on the same authentication mechanisms as the Azure CLI. The tool will use the same authentication context as the Azure CLI if it is installed and authenticated.
- The tool will map the Kusto column types to Avro types as follows:
  - `bool` is mapped to Avro boolean type.
  - `datetime` is mapped to Avro long type with logical type `timestamp-millis`.
  - `decimal` is mapped to a logical Avro type with the `logicalType` set to `decimal` and the `precision` and `scale` set to the values of the `decimal` type in Kusto.
  - `guid` is mapped to Avro string type.
  - `int` is mapped to Avro int type.
  - `long` is mapped to Avro long type.
  - `real` is mapped to Avro double type.
  - `string` is mapped to Avro string type.
  - `timespan` is mapped to a logical Avro type with the `logicalType` set to `duration`.
- For `dynamic` columns, the tool will sample the data in the table to determine the structure of the dynamic column. The tool will map the dynamic column to an Avro record type with fields that correspond to the fields found in the dynamic column. If the dynamic column contains nested dynamic columns, the tool will recursively map those to Avro record types. If records with conflicting structures are found in the dynamic column, the tool will emit a union of record types for the dynamic column.
- If the `--emit-cloudevents-xregistry` option is set, the tool will emit an [xRegistry](http://xregistry.io) registry manifest file with a CloudEvent message definition for each table in the Kusto database and a separate Avro Schema for each table in the embedded schema registry. If one or more tables are found to contain CloudEvent data (as indicated by the presence of the CloudEvents attribute columns), the tool will inspect the content of the `type` (or `__type` or `__type`) columns to determine which CloudEvent types have been stored in the table and will emit a CloudEvent definition and schema for each unique type.

### Convert SQL database schema to Avrotize Schema

avrotize sql2a --connection-string "postgresql://host:5432/mydb?sslmode=require" --username myuser --password mypass --out schema.avsc

# PostgreSQL with SSL (credentials in URL)
avrotize sql2a --connection-string "postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/mydb?sslmode=require" --out schema.avsc

# MySQL with SSL
avrotize sql2a --connection-string "mysql://user:pass@host:3306/mydb?ssl=true" --dialect mysql --out schema.avsc

# SQL Server with Windows Authentication (omit user/password)
avrotize sql2a --connection-string "mssql://@host:1433/mydb" --dialect sqlserver --out schema.avsc

# SQL Server with TLS encryption
avrotize sql2a --connection-string "mssql://user:pass@host:1433/mydb?encrypt=true" --dialect sqlserver --out schema.avsc

# SQLite file
avrotize sql2a --connection-string "/path/to/database.db" --dialect sqlite --out schema.avsc
```

Conversion notes:

- The tool connects to a live database and reads the schema from the information schema or system catalogs.
- Type mappings for each dialect:
  - **PostgreSQL**: All standard types including `uuid`, `jsonb`, `xml`, arrays, and custom types.
  - **MySQL**: Standard types including `json`, `enum`, `set`, and spatial types.
  - **SQL Server**: Standard types including `uniqueidentifier`, `xml`, `money`, and `hierarchyid`.
  - **Oracle**: Standard types including `number`, `clob`, `blob`, and Oracle-specific types.
  - **SQLite**: Dynamic typing mapped based on declared type affinity.
- For JSON/JSONB columns (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and XML columns, the tool samples data to infer the structure. Fields that appear in some but not all records are folded together. If field types conflict across records, the tool emits a union of record types.
- For columns with keys that cannot be valid Avro identifiers (UUIDs, URLs, special characters), the tool generates `map<string, T>` types instead of record types.
- Table and column comments are preserved as Avro `doc` attributes where available.
- Primary key columns are noted in the schema's `unique` attribute.

### Infer Avro schema from JSON files

```bash
avrotize json2a <json_files...> [--out <path>] [--type-name <name>] [--namespace <namespace>] [--sample-size <n>] [--infer-choices] [--choice-depth <n>]
```

Parameters:

- `<json_files...>`: One or more JSON files to analyze. Supports JSON arrays, single objects, and JSONL (JSON Lines) format. Use `@filelist.txt` to read file paths from a response file.

avrotize json2a @file_list.txt --out schema.avsc --infer-choices --choice-depth 2
```

### Infer JSON Structure schema from JSON files

```bash
avrotize json2s <json_files...> [--out <path>] [--type-name <name>] [--base-id <uri>] [--sample-size <n>] [--infer-choices] [--choice-depth <n>] [--infer-enums]
```

Parameters:

- `<json_files...>`: One or more JSON files to analyze. Use `@filelist.txt` to read file paths from a response file.

The inferrer also automatically detects:
- **Datetime patterns**: ISO 8601 timestamps, dates, and times are typed as `datetime`, `date`, or `time`.
- **Required vs optional fields**: Fields present in all records are marked required; sparse fields are optional.

Example:

```bash
# Basic inference
avrotize json2s data.json --out schema.jstruct.json --type-name Person --base-id https://myapi.example.com/schemas/

# Full inference with choices and enums
avrotize json2s events/*.json --out events.jstruct.json --type-name Event --infer-choices --choice-depth 2 --infer-enums

- Text content in mixed-content elements becomes a `#text` field.
- Repeated elements are inferred as arrays.
- Multiple files with different structures are merged into a unified schema.
- Sparse data (fields that appear in some but not all records) is folded into a single type.

### Convert Avrotize Schema to Kusto table declaration

```bash
avrotize a2k <path_to_avro_schema_file> [--out <path_to_kusto_kql_file>] [--record-type <record_type>] [--emit-cloudevents-columns] [--emit-cloudevents-dispatch]
```

Parameters:

- `<path_to_avro_schema_file>`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out`: The path to the Kusto KQL file to write the conversion result to. If omitted, the output is directed to stdout.
- `--record-type`: (optional) The name of the Avro record type to convert to a Kusto table.
- `--emit-cloudevents-columns`: (optional) If set, the tool will add [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) attribute columns to the table: `___id`, `___source`, `___subject`, `___type`, and `___time`.
- `--emit-cloudevents-dispatch`: (optional) If set, the tool will add a table named `_cloudevents_dispatch` to the script or database, which serves as an ingestion and dispatch table for CloudEvents. The table has columns for the core CloudEvents attributes and a `data` column that holds the CloudEvents data. For each table in the Avrotize Schema, the tool will create an update policy that maps events whose `type` attribute matches the Avro type name to the respective table.

Conversion notes:

- Only the Avro `record` type can be mapped to a Kusto table. If the Avrotize Schema contains other types (like `enum` or `array`), the tool will ignore them.
- Only the first `record` type in the Avrotize Schema is converted to a Kusto table. If the Avrotize Schema contains other `record` types, they will be ignored. The `--record-type` option can be used to specify which `record` type to convert.
- The fields of the record are mapped to columns in the Kusto table. Fields that are records or arrays or maps are mapped to columns of type `dynamic` in the Kusto table.

### Convert JSON Structure Schema to Kusto table declaration

```bash
avrotize s2k <path_to_structure_schema_file> [--out <path_to_kusto_kql_file>] [--record-type <record_type>] [--emit-cloudevents-columns] [--emit-cloudevents-dispatch]
```

Parameters:

- `<path_to_structure_schema_file>`: The path to the JSON Structure Schema file to be converted. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out`: The path to the Kusto KQL file to write the conversion result to. If omitted, the output is directed to stdout.
- `--record-type`: (optional) The name of the record type to convert to a Kusto table.
- `--emit-cloudevents-columns`: (optional) If set, the tool will add [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) attribute columns to the table: `___id`, `___source`, `___subject`, `___type`, and `___time`.
- `--emit-cloudevents-dispatch`: (optional) If set, the tool will add a table named `_cloudevents_dispatch` to the script or database, which serves as an ingestion and dispatch table for CloudEvents. The table has columns for the core CloudEvents attributes and a `data` column that holds the CloudEvents data. For each table in the JSON Structure Schema, the tool will create an update policy that maps events whose `type` attribute matches the type name to the respective table.

Conversion notes:

- Only JSON Structure `object` types can be mapped to a Kusto table. Other types (like `enum`, `array`, `choice`) are not directly convertible to tables.
- The tool converts the first `object` type found in the schema, or uses the type specified with `--record-type`.
- Object properties are mapped to columns in the Kusto table. Complex types (objects, arrays, maps, sets, tuples, choices) are mapped to columns of type `dynamic`.
- JSON Structure primitive types are mapped to appropriate Kusto scalar types:
  - `string`, `uri`, `jsonpointer` → `string`
  - `boolean` → `bool`
  - `integer`, `int8`, `uint8`, `int16`, `uint16`, `int32` → `int`
  - `uint32`, `int64`, `uint64` → `long`
  - `int128`, `uint128`, `decimal` → `decimal`
  - `number`, `float`, `double`, `float8`, `binary32`, `binary64` → `real`
  - `date`, `datetime`, `timestamp` → `datetime`
  - `time`, `duration` → `timespan`
  - `uuid` → `guid`
  - `binary` → `dynamic`

Conversion notes:

- The emitted Iceberg file contains only the schema, no data rows.
- The tool only supports writing Iceberg files for Avrotize Schema that describe a single `record` type. If the Avrotize Schema contains a top-level union, the `--record-type` option must be used to specify which record type to emit.
- The fields of the record are mapped to columns in the Iceberg file. Array and record fields are mapped to Iceberg nested types. Avro type unions are mapped to structures, not to Iceberg unions since those are not supported by the PyArrow library used here.

### Convert JSON Structure to Iceberg schema

Conversion notes:

- The emitted Iceberg file contains only the schema, no data rows.
- The tool supports JSON Structure schemas with `type: "object"` at the top level. If the schema contains a `$ref` or the record type is in definitions, the `--record-type` option can be used to specify which type to emit.
- JSON Structure types are mapped to Iceberg types as follows:
  - **Primitive types**: `string` → StringType, `boolean` → BooleanType, numeric types (int8-128, uint8-128, float, double) → appropriate IntegerType/LongType/FloatType/DoubleType
  - **Extended types**: `binary`/`bytes` → BinaryType, `date` → DateType, `time` → TimeType, `datetime`/`timestamp` → TimestampType, `duration` → LongType (microseconds), `decimal` → DecimalType (with precision/scale), `uuid`/`uri`/`jsonpointer` → StringType
  - **Compound types**: `object` → StructType, `array`/`set` → ListType, `map` → MapType, `tuple` → StructType with indexed fields
  - **Choice types**: Mapped to StructType with alternative fields (Iceberg doesn't have native union support)
- Type annotations such as `precision`, `scale`, and validation constraints are preserved where applicable.
- The `$extends` feature is supported - base type properties are included in the conversion.
- Required and optional properties are handled via Iceberg's `required` field flag.

### Convert Parquet schema to Avrotize Schema

- `--namespace`: (optional) The namespace to use in the Avrotize Schema if the Parquet file does not define a namespace.

Conversion notes:

- The tool reads the schema from the Parquet file and converts it to Avrotize Schema. The data in the Parquet file is not read or converted.
- The fields of the Parquet schema are mapped to fields in the Avrotize Schema. Nested fields are mapped to nested records in the Avrotize Schema.

### Convert CSV file to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize csv2a <path_to_csv_file> [--out <path_to_avro_schema_file>] [--namespace <avro_schema_namespace>]
```

Parameters:

- `<path_to_csv_file>`: The path to the CSV file to be converted. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.

avrotize validate events.jsonl --schema events.jstruct.json

# Quiet mode for CI/CD pipelines (exit code only)
avrotize validate data.json --schema schema.avsc --quiet
```

### Validate TMSL scripts locally

```bash
avrotize validate-tmsl [input] [--quiet]
```

Parameters:

- `[input]`: Path to the TMSL JSON file. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--quiet`: (optional) Suppress output. Exit code 0 if valid, 1 if invalid.

Validation notes:

- Performs local structural validation aligned with Microsoft TMSL object definitions for compatibility level 1200+.
- Validates `createOrReplace` command payload shape for the database/model/table/column path.
- Enforces documented column `dataType` enum values (`automatic`, `string`, `int64`, `double`, `dateTime`, `decimal`, `boolean`, `binary`, `unknown`, `variant`).
- Enforces strict object property checks (`additionalProperties: false`) for the validated subset.
- This is not a semantic engine validation; semantic checks still require execution against an XMLA endpoint.

Example:

```bash
# Validate a generated TMSL file
avrotize validate-tmsl model.tmsl.json

# CI mode with exit code only
avrotize validate-tmsl model.tmsl.json --quiet
```

### Convert JSON Structure schema to GraphQL schema

```bash
avrotize s2graphql [input] --out <path_to_graphql_schema_file>
```

Parameters:

- `[input]`: The path to the JSON Structure schema file. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out <path_to_graphql_schema_file>`: The path to the output GraphQL schema file.

Conversion notes:

- Converts JSON Structure Core schema to GraphQL schema language (SDL)
- Supports all JSON Structure Core primitive types (string, number, boolean, null)
- Supports extended primitives (binary, int8-128, uint8-128, float/double, decimal, date, datetime, time, duration, uuid, uri, jsonpointer)
- Supports compound types (object, array, set, map, tuple, any, choice)
- Resolves type references ($ref) and maintains proper dependency ordering
- Maps JSON Structure namespaces to GraphQL types with simple names
- Generates custom scalars for specialized types (Date, DateTime, UUID, URI, Decimal, Binary, JSON)
- Required properties are marked with `!` in GraphQL
- Arrays and sets are represented as GraphQL lists `[Type]`
- Maps are represented using the JSON scalar type

Example:

```bash
# Convert a JSON Structure schema to GraphQL
avrotize s2graphql myschema.struct.json --out myschema.graphql

# Read from stdin and write to stdout
cat myschema.struct.json | avrotize s2graphql > myschema.graphql
```

### Convert Avrotize schema to GraphQL schema

```bash
avrotize a2graphql [input] --out <path_to_graphql_schema_file>
```

Parameters:

- `[input]`: The path to the Avrotize schema file. If omitted, the file is read from stdin.
- `--out <path_to_graphql_schema_file>`: The path to the output GraphQL schema file.

Conversion notes:

- Converts Avrotize schema to GraphQL schema language (SDL)
- Avro primitive types (string, int, long, float, double, boolean, bytes) are mapped to GraphQL scalar types
- Avro logical types (date, timestamp-millis, decimal, uuid) are mapped to custom GraphQL scalars
- Avro record types become GraphQL object types
- Avro arrays become GraphQL lists `[Type]`
- Avro maps are represented using the JSON scalar type
- Avro unions are converted to GraphQL union types
- Avro enums become GraphQL enum types

Example:

```bash
# Convert an Avrotize schema to GraphQL
avrotize a2graphql myschema.avsc --out myschema.graphql

# Read from stdin and write to stdout
cat myschema.avsc | avrotize a2graphql > myschema.graphql
```
