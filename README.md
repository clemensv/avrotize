# Avrotize

Avrotize is a ["Rosetta Stone"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) for
data structure definitions, allowing you to convert between numerous data and
database schema formats and to generate code for different programming
languages.

It is, for instance, a well-documented and predictable converter and code
generator for data structures originally defined in JSON Schema (of arbitrary
complexity).

The tool leans on the Apache Avro-derived [Avrotize
Schema](specs/avrotize-schema.md) as its schema model.

- Programming languages: Python, C#, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, Go, C++
- SQL Databases: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, SQLite, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, DB2
- Other databases: KQL/Kusto, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Elasticsearch, DynamoDB, CosmosDB
- Data schema formats: Avro, JSON Schema, XML Schema (XSD), Protocol Buffers 2
  and 3, ASN.1, Apache Parquet

## Installation

You can install Avrotize from PyPI, [having installed Python 3.11 or
later](https://www.python.org/downloads/):

```bash
pip install avrotize
```

## Overview

You can use Avrotize to convert between Avro/Avrotize Schema and other schema
formats like JSON Schema, XML Schema (XSD), Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), ASN.1,
and database schema formats like Kusto Data Table Definition (KQL) and T-SQL
Table Definition (SQL). That means you can also convert from JSON Schema to
Protobuf going via Avrotize Schema.

You can also generate C#, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python code from
Avrotize Schema documents. The difference to the native Avro tools is that
Avrotize can emit data classes without Avro library dependencies and,
optionally, with annotations for JSON serialization libraries like Jackson or
System.Text.Json.

The tool does not convert data (instances of schemas), only the data structure
definitions.

Mind that the primary objective of the tool is the conversion of schemas that
describe data structures used in applications, databases, and message systems.
While the project's internal tests do cover a lot of ground, it is nevertheless
not a primary goal of the tool to convert every complex document schema like
those used for devops pipeline or system configuration files.

## Why?

Data structure definitions are an essential part of data exchange,
serialization, and storage. They define the shape and type of data, and they are
foundational for tooling and libraries for working with the data. Nearly all
data schema languages are coupled to a specific data exchange or storage format,
locking the definitions to that format.

Avrotize is designed as a tool to "unlock" data definitions from JSON Schema or
XML Schema and make them usable in other contexts. The intent is also to lay a
foundation for transcoding data from one format to another, by translating the
schema definitions as accurately as possible into the schema model of the target
format's schema. The transcoding of the data itself requires separate tools
that are beyond the scope of this project.

The use of the term "data structure definition" and not "data object definition"
is quite intentional. The focus of the tool is on data structures that can be
used for messaging and eventing payloads, for data serialization, and for
database tables, with the goal that those structures can be mapped cleanly from
and to common programming language types.

Therefore, Avrotize intentionally ignores common techniques to model
object-oriented inheritance. For instance, when converting from JSON Schema, all
content from `allOf` expressions is merged into a single record type rather than
trying to model the inheritance tree in Avro.

## Avrotize Schema

Avrotize Schema is a schema model that is a full superset of the popular Apache
Avrotize Schema model. Avrotize Schema is the "pivot point" for this tool. All
schemas are converted from and to Avrotize Schema.

Since Avrotize Schema is a superset of Avrotize Schema and uses its extensibility
features, every Avrotize Schema is also a valid Avrotize Schema and vice versa.

Why did we pick Avro Schema as the foundational schema model?

Avro Schema ...

- provides a simple, clean, and concise way to define data structures. It is
  quite easy to understand and use.
- is self-contained by design without having or requiring external references.
  Avro Schema can express complex data structure hierarchies spanning multiple
  namespace boundaries all in a single file, which neither JSON Schema nor
  XML Schema nor Protobuf can do.
- can be resolved by code generators and other tools "top-down" since it
  enforces dependencies to be ordered such that no forward-referencing occurs.
- emerged out of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem and is widely used for
  serialization and storage of data and for data exchange between systems.
- supports native and logical types that cover the needs of many business and
  technical use cases.
- can describe the popular JSON data encoding very well and in a way that always
  maps cleanly to a wide range of programming languages and systems. In
  contrast, it's quite easy to inadvertently define a JSON Schema that is very
  difficult to map to a programming language structure. 
- is itself expressed as JSON. That makes it easy to parse and generate, which
  is not the case for Protobuf or ASN.1, which require bespoke parsers.

> It needs to be noted here that while Avro Schema is great for defining data
> structures, and data classes generated from Avro Schema using this tool or
> other tools can be used to with the most popular JSON serialization libraries,
> the Apache Avro project's own JSON encoding has fairly grave interoperability
> issues with common usage of JSON. Avrotize defines an alternate JSON encoding
> in [`avrojson.md`](avrojson.md).

Avro Schema does not support all the bells and whistles of XML Schema or JSON
Schema, but that is a feature, not a bug, as it ensures the portability of the
schemas across different systems and infrastructures. Specifically, Avro Schema
does not support many of the data validation features found in JSON Schema or
XML Schema. There are no `pattern`, `format`, `minimum`, `maximum`, or `required`
keywords in Avro Schema, and Avro does not support conditional validation.

In a system where data originates as XML or JSON described by a validating XML
Schema or JSON Schema, the assumption we make here is that data will be
validated using its native schema language first, and then the Avro Schema will
be used for transformation or transfer or storage.

## Adding CloudEvents columns for database tables

When converting Avrotize Schema to Kusto Data Table Definition (KQL), T-SQL Table
Definition (SQL), or Parquet Schema, the tool can add special columns for
[CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) attributes. CNCF CloudEvents is a
specification for describing event data in a common way.

The rationale for adding such columns to database tables is that messages and
events commonly separate event metadata from the payload data, while that
information is merged when events are projected into a database. The metadata
often carries important context information about the event that is not
contained in the payload itself. Therefore, the tool can add those columns to
the database tables for easy alignment of the message context with the payload
when building event stores.

### Convert Proto schema to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize p2a --proto <path_to_proto_file> --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file>
```

Parameters:

- `--proto`: The path to the Protobuf schema file to be converted.
- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to write the conversion result to.

Conversion notes:

- Proto 2 and Proto 3 syntax are supported.
- Proto package names are mapped to Avro namespaces. The tool does resolve imports
  and consolidates all imported types into a single Avrotize Schema file.
- The tool embeds all 'well-known' Protobuf 3.0 types in Avro format and injects
  them as needed when the respective types are imported. Only the `Timestamp` type is
  mapped to the Avro logical type 'timestamp-millis'. The rest of the well-known
  Protobuf types are kept as Avro record types with the same field names and types.
- Protobuf allows any scalar type as key in a `map`, Avro does not. When converting
  from Proto to Avro, the type information for the map keys is ignored.
- The field numbers in message types are not mapped to the positions of the
  fields in Avro records. The fields in Avro are ordered as they appear in the
  Proto schema. Consequently, the Avrotize Schema also ignores the `extensions` and
  `reserved` keywords in the Proto schema.
- The `optional` keyword results in an Avro field being nullable (union with the
  `null` type), while the `required` keyword results in a non-nullable field.
  The `repeated` keyword results in an Avro field being an array of the field
  type.
- The `oneof` keyword in Proto is mapped to an Avro union type. 
- All `options` in the Proto schema are ignored.


### Convert Avrotize Schema to Proto schema

```bash
avrotize a2p --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --proto <path_to_proto_directory>
```

Parameters:

- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted.
- `--proto`: The path to the Protobuf schema directory to write the conversion result to.

Conversion notes:

- Avro namespaces are resolved into distinct proto package definitions. The tool will
  create a new `.proto` file with the package definition and an `import` statement for
  each namespace found in the Avrotize Schema.
- Avro type unions `[]` are converted to `oneof` expressions in Proto. Avro allows for
  maps and arrays in the type union, whereas Proto only supports scalar types and
  message type references. The tool will therefore emit message types containing
  a single array or map field for any such case and add it to the containing type,
  and will also recursively resolve further unions in the array and map values.
- The sequence of fields in a message follows the sequence of fields in the Avro
  record. When type unions need to be resolved into `oneof` expressions, the alternative
  fields need to be assigned field numbers, which will shift the field numbers for any
  subsequent fields.

### Convert JSON schema to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize j2a --jsons <path_to_json_schema_file> --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> [--namespace <avro_schema_namespace>]
```

Parameters:

- `--jsons`: The path to the JSON schema file to be converted.
- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to write the conversion result to.
- `--namespace`: (optional) The namespace to use in the Avrotize Schema if the JSON
  schema does not define a namespace.

Conversion notes:

- [JSON Schema Handling in Avrotize](jsonschema.md)

### Convert Avrotize Schema to JSON schema

```bash
avrotize a2j --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --json <path_to_json_schema_file>
```

Parameters:

- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted.
- `--json`: The path to the JSON schema file to write the conversion result to.

Conversion notes:

- [JSON Schema Handling in Avrotize](jsonschema.md)

### Convert XML Schema (XSD) to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize x2a --xsd <path_to_xsd_file> --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> [--namespace <avro_schema_namespace>]
```

Parameters:

- `--xsd`: The path to the XML schema file to be converted.
- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to write the conversion result to.
- `--namespace`: (optional) The namespace to use in the Avrotize Schema if the XML
  schema does not define a namespace.

Conversion notes:

- All XML Schema constructs are mapped to Avro record types with fields, whereby
  **both**, elements and attributes, become fields in the record. XML is therefore
  flattened into fields and this aspect of the structure is not preserved.
- Avro does not support `xsd:any` as Avro does not support arbitrary typing and
  must always use a named type. The tool will map `xsd:any` to a field `any`
  typed as a union that allows scalar values or two levels of array and/or map
  nesting.
- `simpleType` declarations that define enums are mapped to `enum` types in Avro.
  All other facets are ignored and simple types are mapped to the corresponding
  Avro type.
- `complexType` declarations that have simple content where a base type is augmented
  with attributes is mapped to a record type in Avro. Any other facets defined on
  the complex type are ignored.
- If the schema defines a single root element, the tool will emit a single Avro
  record type. If the schema defines multiple root elements, the tool will emit a
  union of record types, each corresponding to a root element.
- All fields in the resulting Avrotize Schema are annotated with an `xmlkind`
  extension attribute that indicates whether the field was an `element` or an
  `attribute` in the XML schema.

## Convert Avrotize Schema to XML schema

```bash
avrotize a2x --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --xsd <path_to_xsd_schema_file>
```

Parameters:

- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted.
- `--xsd`: The path to the XML schema file to write the conversion result to.

Conversion notes:

- Avro record types are mapped to XML Schema complex types with elements.
- Avro enum types are mapped to XML Schema simple types with restrictions.
- Avro logical types are mapped to XML Schema simple types with restrictions
  where required.
- Avro unions are mapped to standalone XSD simple type definitions with a
  union restriction if all union types are primitives.
- Avro unions with complex types are resolved into distinct types for
  each option that are then joined with a choice.

## Convert ASN.1 schema to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize asn2a --asn <path_to_asn1_schema_file>[,<path_to_asn1_schema_file>,...]  --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file>
```

Parameters:

- `--asn`: The path to the ASN.1 schema file to be converted. The tool supports
  multiple files in a comma-separated list.
- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to write the conversion result to.

Conversion notes:

- All ASN.1 types are mapped to Avro record types, enums, and unions. Avro does
  not support the same level of nesting of types as ASN.1, the tool will map
  the types to the best fit.
- The tool will map the following ASN.1 types to Avro types:
  - `SEQUENCE` and `SET` are mapped to Avro record types.
  - `CHOICE` is mapped to an Avro record types with all fields being optional. While
     the `CHOICE` type technically corresponds to an Avro union, the ASN.1 type
     has different named fields for each option, which is not a feature of Avro unions.
  - `OBJECT IDENTIFIER` is mapped to an Avro string type.
  - `ENUMERATED` is mapped to an Avro enum type.
  - `SEQUENCE OF` and `SET OF` are mapped to Avro array type.
  - `BIT STRING` is mapped to Avro bytes type.
  - `OCTET STRING` is mapped to Avro bytes type.
  - `INTEGER` is mapped to Avro long type.
  - `REAL` is mapped to Avro double type.
  - `BOOLEAN` is mapped to Avro boolean type.
  - `NULL` is mapped to Avro null type.
  - `UTF8String`, `PrintableString`, `IA5String`, `BMPString`, `NumericString`, `TeletexString`,
    `VideotexString`, `GraphicString`, `VisibleString`, `GeneralString`, `UniversalString`,
    `CharacterString`, `T61String` are all mapped to Avro string type.
  - All other ASN.1 types are mapped to Avro string type.
- The ability to parse ASN.1 schema files is limited and the tool may not be able
  to parse all ASN.1 files. The tool is based on the Python asn1tools package and
  is limited to that package's capabilities.

### Convert Kusto table definition to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize k2a --kusto-uri <kusto_cluster_uri> --kusto-database <kusto_database> --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --emit-cloudevents-xregistry
```

Parameters:

- `--kusto-uri`: The URI of the Kusto cluster to connect to.
- `--kusto-database`: The name of the Kusto database to read the table definitions from.
- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to write the conversion result to.
- `--emit-cloudevents-xregistry`: (optional) See discussion below.

Conversion notes:
- The tool directly connects to the Kusto cluster and reads the table
  definitions from the specified database. The tool will convert all tables in
  the database to Avro record types, returned in a top-level type union.
- Connecting to the Kusto cluster leans on the same authentication mechanisms as
  the Azure CLI. The tool will use the same authentication context as the Azure CLI
  if it is installed and authenticated.
- The tool will map the Kusto column types to Avro types as follows:
  - `bool` is mapped to Avro boolean type.
  - `datetime` is mapped to Avro long type with logical type `timestamp-millis`.
  - `decimal` is mapped to a logical Avro type with the `logicalType` set to `decimal`
    and the `precision` and `scale` set to the values of the `decimal` type in Kusto.
  - `guid` is mapped to Avro string type.
  - `int` is mapped to Avro int type.
  - `long` is mapped to Avro long type.
  - `real` is mapped to Avro double type.
  - `string` is mapped to Avro string type.
  - `timespan` is mapped to a logical Avro type with the `logicalType` set to
    `duration`.
- For `dynamic` columns, the tool will sample the data in the table to determine
  the structure of the dynamic column. The tool will map the dynamic column to an
  Avro record type with fields that correspond to the fields found in the dynamic
  column. If the dynamic column contains nested dynamic columns, the tool will
  recursively map those to Avro record types. If records with conflicting 
  structures are found in the dynamic column, the tool will emit a union of record
  types for the dynamic column.
- If the `--emit-cloudevents-xregistry` option is set, the tool will emit an
  [xRegistry](http://xregistry.io) registry manifest file with a CloudEvent
  message definition for each table in the Kusto database and a separate Avro
  Schema for each table in the embedded schema registry. If one or more tables
  are found to contain CloudEvent data (as indicated by the presence of the
  CloudEvents attribute columns), the tool will inspect the content of the
  `type` (or `__type` or `__type`) columns to determine which CloudEvent types
  have been stored in the table and will emit a CloudEvent definition and schema
  for each unique type.

### Convert Avrotize Schema to Kusto table declaration

```bash
avrotize a2k --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --kusto <path_to_kusto_kql_file> [--record-type <record_type>] [--emit-cloudevents-columns] [--emit-cloudevents-dispatch]
```

Parameters:

- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted.
- `--kusto`: The path to the Kusto KQL file to write the conversion result to.
- `--record-type`: (optional) The name of the Avro record type to convert to a Kusto table.
- `--emit-cloudevents-columns`: (optional) If set, the tool will add
  [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) attribute columns to the table: `___id`,
  `___source`, `___subject`, `___type`, and `___time`.
- `--emit-cloudevents-dispatch`: (optional) If set, the tool will add a table named
  `_cloudevents_dispatch` to the script or database, which serves as an ingestion and
  dispatch table for CloudEvents. The table has columns for the core CloudEvents attributes
  and a `data` column that holds the CloudEvents data. For each table in the Avrotize Schema,
  the tool will create an update policy that maps events whose `type` attribute matches
  the Avro type name to the respective table.
  

Conversion notes:

- Only the Avro `record` type can be mapped to a Kusto table. If the Avrotize Schema
  contains other types (like `enum` or `array`), the tool will ignore them.
- Only the first `record` type in the Avrotize Schema is converted to a Kusto table.
  If the Avrotize Schema contains other `record` types, they will be ignored. The
  `--record-type` option can be used to specify which `record` type to convert.
- The fields of the record are mapped to columns in the Kusto table. Fields that
  are records or arrays or maps are mapped to columns of type `dynamic` in the
  Kusto table.

### Convert Avrotize Schema to T-SQL table definition

```bash
avrotize a2tsql --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --tsql <path_to_sql_file> [--record-type <record_type>] [--emit-cloudevents-columns]
```

Parameters:

- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted.
- `--tsql`: The path to the T-SQL file to write the conversion result to.
- `--record-type`: (optional) The name of the Avro record type to convert to a T-SQL table.
- `--emit-cloudevents-columns`: (optional) If set, the tool will add
  [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) attribute columns to the table: `__id`,
  `__source`, `__subject`, `__type`, and `__time`.

Conversion notes:

- Only the Avro `record` type can be mapped to a T-SQL table. If the Avrotize Schema
  contains other types (like `enum` or `array`), the tool will ignore them.
- Only the first `record` type in the Avrotize Schema is converted to a T-SQL table.
  If the Avrotize Schema contains other `record` types, they will be ignored. The
  `--record-type` option can be used to specify which `record` type to convert.
- The fields of the record are mapped to columns in the T-SQL table. Fields of
  type `record` or `array` or `map` are mapped to columns of type `varchar(max)` in
  the T-SQL table and it's assumed for them to hold JSON data.
- The emitted script sets extended properties to the columns with the Avrotize Schema
  definition of the field in a JSON format. This allows for easy introspection of
  the serialized Avrotize Schema in the field definition.

## Convert Avrotize Schema to empty Parquet file

```bash
avrotize a2pq --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --parquet <path_to_parquet_schema_file> [--record-type <record-type-from-avro>] [--emit-cloudevents-columns]
```

Parameters:

- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted.
- `--parquet`: The path to the Parquet schema file to write the conversion result to.
- `--record-type`: (optional) The name of the Avro record type to convert to a Parquet schema.
- `--emit-cloudevents-columns`: (optional) If set, the tool will add
  [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) attribute columns to the Parquet schema:
  `__id`, `__source`, `__subject`, `__type`, and `__time`.

Conversion notes:

- The emitted Parquet file contains only the schema, no data rows.
- The tool only supports writing Parquet files for Avrotize Schema that describe a
  single `record` type. If the Avrotize Schema contains a top-level union, the
  `--record-type` option must be used to specify which record type to emit.
- The fields of the record are mapped to columns in the Parquet file. Array and
  record fields are mapped to Parquet nested types. Avro type unions are mapped
  to structures, not to Parquet unions since those are not supported by the
  PyArrow library used here.

## Convert Parquet schema to Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize pq2a --parquet <path_to_parquet_schema_file> --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --namespace <avro_schema_namespace>
```

Parameters:

- `--parquet`: The path to the Parquet file whose schema is to be converted.
- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to write the conversion result to.
- `--namespace`: The namespace to use in the Avrotize Schema.

Conversion notes:

- The tool reads the schema from the Parquet file and converts it to an Avro
  schema. The Avrotize Schema is written to the specified file.

### Generate C# code from Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize a2csharp --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --csharp <path_to_csharp_directory> [--avro-annotation] [--system-text-json-annotation] [--newtonsoft-json-annotation] [--pascal-properties]
```

Parameters:
- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted.
- `--csharp`: The path to the C# directory to write the conversion result to.
- `--avro-annotation`: (optional) If set, the tool will add Avro annotations to the C# classes.
- `--system-text-json-annotation`: (optional) If set, the tool will add System.Text.Json annotations to the C# classes.
- `--newtonsoft-json-annotation`: (optional) If set, the tool will add Newtonsoft.Json annotations to the C# classes.
- `--pascal-properties`: (optional) If set, the tool will use PascalCase properties in the C# classes.
- `--namespace`: (optional) The namespace to use in the generated C# classes.

Conversion notes:
- The tool generates C# classes that represent the Avrotize Schema as data classes.
- Using the `--system-text-json-annotation` or `--newtonsoft-json-annotation` option
  will add annotations for the respective JSON serialization library to the generated
  C# classes. Because the [`JSON Schema to Avro`](#convert-json-schema-to-avrotize-schema) conversion generally
  preserves the JSON Schema structure in the Avrotize Schema, the generated C# classes
  can be used to serialize and deserialize data that is valid per the input JSON schema.
- Only the `--system-text-json-annotation` option generates classes that support type unions.
- The classes are generated into a directory structure that reflects the Avro namespace
  structure. The tool drops a minimal, default `.csproj` project file into the given
  directory if none exists.

### Generate Java code from Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize a2java --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --java <path_to_java_directory> [--package <java_package_name>] [--avro-annotation] [--jackson-annotation] [--pascal-properties]
```

Parameters:
- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted.
- `--java`: The path to the Java directory to write the conversion result to.
- `--package`: (optional) The Java package name to use in the generated Java classes.
- `--avro-annotation`: (optional) If set, the tool will add Avro annotations to the Java classes.
- `--jackson-annotation`: (optional) If set, the tool will add Jackson annotations to the Java classes.
- `--pascal-properties`: (optional) If set, the tool will use PascalCase properties in the Java classes.

Conversion notes:

- The tool generates Java classes that represent the Avrotize Schema as data classes. 
- Using the `--jackson-annotation` option will add annotations for the Jackson 
  JSON serialization library to the generated Java classes. Because the 
  [`JSON Schema to Avro`](#convert-json-schema-to-avrotize-schema) conversion generally
  preserves the JSON Schema structure in the Avrotize Schema, the generated Java classes
  can be used to serialize and deserialize data that is valid per the input JSON schema.
- The directory `/src/main/java` is created in the specified directory and the
  generated Java classes are written to this directory. The tool drops a
  minimal, default `pom.xml` Maven project file into the given directory if none
  exists.

Read more about the Java code generation in the [Java code generation documentation](javacodegen.md).

### Generate Python code from Avrotize Schema

This command generates Python dataclasses from an Avrotize Schema.

```bash
avrotize a2py --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --python <path_to_python_directory> [--package <python_package_name>]
```

- `--python`: The path to the Python directory to write the conversion result to.
- `--package`: (optional) The Python package name to use in the generated Python classes.
- `--avro-annotation`: (optional) If set, the tool will add Avro annotations to the Python classes.
- `--dataclasses-json-annotation`: (optional) If set, the tool will add dataclasses-json annotations to the Python classes

Conversion notes:
- The tool generates Python dataclasses (Python 3.7 or later)
- The classes are generated into a directory structure that reflects the Avro namespace
  structure. The tool drops a minimal, default `__init__.py` file into any created
  package directories if none exists.

### Generate TypeScript code from Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize a2ts --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --ts <path_to_typescript_directory> [--package <typescript_namespace>] [--avro-annotation] [--typedjson-annotation]
``` 

Parameters:
- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted.
- `--ts`: The path to the TypeScript directory to write the conversion result to.
- `--package`: (optional) The TypeScript namespace to use in the generated TypeScript classes.
- `--avro-annotation`: (optional) If set, the tool will add Avro annotations to the TypeScript classes.
- `--typedjson-annotation`: (optional) If set, the tool will add TypedJSON annotations to the TypeScript classes.

Conversion notes:
- The tool generates TypeScript interfaces that represent the Avrotize Schema as data classes.
- Using the `--typedjson-annotation` option will add annotations for the TypedJSON
  JSON serialization library to the generated TypeScript classes. Because the
  [`JSON Schema to Avro`](#convert-json-schema-to-avrotize-schema) conversion generally
  preserves the JSON Schema structure in the Avrotize Schema, the generated TypeScript
  classes can be used to serialize and deserialize data that is valid per the input JSON schema.
- The classes are generated into a directory structure that reflects the Avro namespace

### Generate JavaScript code from Avrotize Schema

```bash
avrotize a2js --avsc <path_to_avro_schema_file> --js <path_to_javascript_directory> [--package <javascript_namespace>] [--avro-annotation]
```

Parameters:
- `--avsc`: The path to the Avrotize Schema file to be converted.
- `--js`: The path to the JavaScript directory to write the conversion result to.
- `--package`: (optional) The JavaScript namespace to use in the generated JavaScript classes.
- `--avro-annotation`: (optional) If set, the tool will add Avro annotations to the JavaScript classes.

Conversion notes:
- The tool generates JavaScript classes that represent the Avrotize Schema as data classes.
- The classes are generated into a directory structure that reflects the Avro namespace
