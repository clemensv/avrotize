# Avrotize 

*EXPERIMENTAL. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.*

[Avrotize](https://github.com/clemensv/avrotize) is a
["Rosetta Stone"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) for data
structure definitions, allowing you to convert between numerous data and
database schema formats and to generate code for different programming
languages.

It is, for instance, a well-documented and predictable converter and code
generator for data structures originally defined in JSON Schema (of arbitrarys
complexity).

The tool leans on the Apache Avro-derived
["Avrotize Schema"](https://github.com/clemensv/avrotize/specs) as its schema
model.

  - Programming languages: Python, C#, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, Go, C++
  - SQL Databases: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, SQLite, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, DB2
  - Other databases: KQL/Kusto, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Elasticsearch, DynamoDB, CosmosDB
  - Data schema formats: Avro, JSON Schema, XML Schema (XSD), Protocol Buffers 2
    and 3, ASN.1, Apache Parquet

## Features

The Visual Studio Code extension for Avrotize provides a user-friendly interface
to the Avrotize tool, allowing you to convert between different data structure
formats and generate code for different programming languages. You will find the
conversion commands in the context menu of the explorer view.

## Requirements

The Avrotize tool must be installed on your system and available in the path.
Avrotize requires Python 3.11 or later to be installed on your system first. You
can then install Avrotize using pip:

```bash
pip install avrotize
``` 


## Release Notes
